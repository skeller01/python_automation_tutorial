### Step 2: Generate Questions

| Goal ID | Question                                                                                                           |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| G1      | How effectively does the system capture and retain institutional knowledge?                                        |
| G2      | How seamlessly does the SharePoint system integrate with existing systems?                                         |
| G3      | What percentage of existing documents have been successfully migrated and are compliant with management policies? |
| G4      | How efficiently can users search, retrieve, and manage documents across the system?                               |

### Step 3: Determine Specific Measures

| Question ID | Ideal Metric                                | Approx Metric                              | 
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Q1          | Number of knowledge assets retained monthly | User surveys on knowledge retrieval ease   | 
| Q2          | Integration success rate                    | Number of manual interventions required    | 
| Q3          | Percentage of documents migrated            | Random checks for compliance adherence     | 
| Q4          | Time taken to search and retrieve documents | User feedback on efficiency                | 

### Step 4: Data Collection Methods

| Metric ID   | Data Collection Method                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| M1          | Automated tracking of document and knowledge asset creation in SharePoint; regular user surveys.                                                       |
| M2          | System logs to monitor integration points and incidents of manual intervention; user feedback on integration usability.                                |
| M3          | Automated reports from SharePoint showing migration statistics; audits for compliance with record management policies.                                 |
| M4          | Analytics on search functionality usage within SharePoint; user surveys on the ease of finding and managing documents.                                  |

This structure provides a systematic approach to defining, measuring, and evaluating the objectives of the project to enhance records and knowledge management using SharePoint Online. The goals are defined with clarity to ensure that each aspect of the project's requirements is addressed. The questions help to convert these goals into quantifiable objectives, leading to the identification of specific metrics. Finally, data collection methods are suggested to gather the necessary information to assess these metrics effectively.
